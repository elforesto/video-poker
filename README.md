# video-poker
Text-based video poker program in C++. Includes Card, Deck, and Hand classes and a simple program tying them all together. I completed this as a class project and hope that by sharing the results others may also benefit.

To-do:
- Input validation (there is little to none)
- Fancier graphics via ASCII box drawing symbols and/or changing the foreground/background colors
- Better controls for selecting which cards to discard/redraw
